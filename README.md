- 👋 Hi, I’m Behzad Ranjbarnia, current PhD candidate of Griffith University at Cities Research Institute working my project on Mobility-as-a-Service during mega-events
- 👀 I’m interested in utilizing Machine Learning Algrithms and Explanaible Artificial Intelligence in analyzing, predicting and interpreting data. My goal is to develop models that
not only predict behaviors but also provide insights into the underlying patterns and factors driving these dynamics.
- 🌱 I am actively enhancing my expertise in various Machine Learning techniques (SVM, RF, DNN etc.), focusing on both supervised and unsupervised
learning models to better handle complex, real-world datasets focusing on transportation planning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with fellow researchers and industry experts who are interested in the intersection of ML, and XAI.
I am particularly keen on projects that aim to improve urban mobility and planning systems through innovative uses of technology.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me via LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/behzad-ranjbarnia-b623a1a6) or email me at b.ranjbarnia@gmail.com or behzad.ranjbarnia@griffithuni.edu.au for potential collaborations, research inquiries, or just a chat.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Aside from my academic pursuits, I am actively collaborating with the Department of Transport and Main Roads within the Queensland Government as part of my PhD project. This partnership aims to integrate advanced Machine Learning and AI strategies into real-world transportation planning and management, particularly focusing on enhancing mobility services during large-scale public events. I'm also a big fan of staying active through both indoor gym workouts and outdoor exercises, which keeps me energized and ready to tackle complex research challenges.
