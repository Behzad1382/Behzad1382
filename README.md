- 👋 Hi, I’m Behzad Ranjbarnia, current PhD candidate of Griffith University at Cities Research Institute working my project on Mobility-as-a-Service during mega-events
- 👀 I’m interested in utilizing Machine Learning Algrithms and Explanaible Artificial Intelligence in analyzing, predicting and interpreting data. My goal is to develop models that
not only predict behaviors but also provide insights into the underlying patterns and factors driving these dynamics.
- 🌱 I am actively enhancing my expertise in various Machine Learning techniques (SVM, RF, DNN etc.), focusing on both supervised and unsupervised
learning models to better handle complex, real-world datasets focusing on transportation planning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with fellow researchers and industry experts who are interested in the intersection of , ML, XAI, urban mobility, and urban planning.
I am particularly keen on projects that aim to improve urban mobility systems through innovative uses of technology.
